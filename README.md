# Exploiting NVM PIM 


This is for "Exploiting Processing-in-memory for Searching and Clustering on High-dimensional Data"(under review).  
Similarity computation is a core subroutine of many searching and clustering algorithms on high-dimensional data. 
The performance bottleneck in the applications of high-dimensional data is due to substantial amount of data transferred from memory to processors, which is known as "memory wall" problem. 
This work proposes to utilize non-volatile memory (NVM), specifically, ReRAM based processing-in-memory (PIM) to accelerate a given similarity-based data searching and clustering algorithm. 

## Accelerating algorithm with ReRAM PIM
We propose a framework to exploit ReRAM PIM to accelerate the computation of a given similarity-based searching and clustering algorithm. 
The commercial ReRAM PIM device is still inaccessible, like prior NVM PIM related research, our experiments are based on simulation.
The experiment software that we use:

- [Performance profiling tool](#security)
- [NVM PIM simulator](#background)
- [NVM system emulator](#install)
- [Hardware-aware compress and optimization analyzer](#usage)
- [API](#api)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)

## Performance Profiling
We use performance profiling which helps us identify the bottleneck of an algorithm.
ReRAM PIM mainly support sum, dot-product, and simple logic operation such as AND, OR. The limited functionality of ReRAM PIM makes it impractical to run the entire algorithm. Hence, we aim to identify the performance bottleneck, and explore PIM to promote the bottleneck.
We propose performance two kinds of profiling:
1. Performance breakdown by hardware components.

2. Performance breakdown by functions.

### Performance breakdown by hardware components.
You may use the popular processor profiling tool, PAPI, PCM and VTune.
PAPI: https://icl.utk.edu/papi/
PCM: https://github.com/opcm/pcm
VTune: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/vtune-profiler.html


PAPI:
With our personal experience, PAPI is most convenient as it support more general hardware platform with almost contemporary processors.
See [/PAPI/.cpp](https://github.com/Eilowangfang/Exploiting_ReRAM_PIM/blob/master/PAPI/main.cpp) as an example of using PAPI.

PCM:
The usage of PCM is similar to PCM. PCM mostly refer to the events to access processor registers directly, and PAPI provide more packaged API interface.  
See [/PAPI/.cpp](https://github.com/Eilowangfang/Exploiting_ReRAM_PIM/blob/master/PAPI/main.cpp) as an example of using PCM.


## NVM PIM simulator

Quartz:
Quartz currently support only SandyBridge/IvyBridge/Haswell CPU.
The Broadwell CPU such as Intel Xeon E5-2620v4 is not supported.
We expend Quartz souce code to support Browdwell Quartz, and you may refer to folder:
/Quartz-Broadwellsupport/
