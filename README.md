# Exploiting_ReRAM_PIM
This is for "Exploiting Processing-in-memory for Searching and Clustering on High-dimensional Data"(under review).  
Similarity computation is a core subroutine of many searching and clustering algorithms on high-dimensional data. 
The performance bottleneck in the applications of high-dimensional data is due to substantial amount of data transferred from memory to processors,
which is known as "memory wall" problem. 
This work proposes to utilize non-volatile memory (NVM), specifically, ReRAM based processing-in-memory (PIM) 
to accelerate a given similarity-based data searching and clustering algorithm. The commerical ReRAM PIM devicce is sitll inaccessible, like prior NVM PIM related research, our experiemnts are based on simulation.   


Accelerating algorithm with ReRAM PIM.  
We propose a framework to exploit ReRAM PIM to accelerate the computation of a given similarity-based searching and clustering algorithm.  
The framework contains steps:   


A. performance profiling    
We present performance profiling which helps us identify the bottleneck of an algorithm.    
ReRAM PIM mainly support sum, dot-product, and simple logic operation such as AND, OR.   
The limited functionality of ReRAM PIM makes it impractical to run the entire algorithm.     
Hence, we aim to identify the performance bottleneck, and explore PIM to promote hte bottleneck.     
We propose perfromance two kinds of profiling   
1. Performance breakdown by hardware components.    
2. Performance breakdown by functions.    

1. Performance breakdown by hardware components:   
you may use the popular processor profiling tool, PAPI, PCM and VTune.   
PAPI: https://icl.utk.edu/papi/   
PCM: https://github.com/opcm/pcm   
VTune: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/vtune-profiler.html   
    
PAPI:    
With my personal experience, PAPI is most convenient as it support more general hardware platform with almost contemporary processors.  
/PAPI/mian.cpp shows an example of using PAPI.

PCM:    
PCM currently support only SandyBridge/IvyBridge/Haswell CPU.   
The Broadwell CPU such as Intel Xeon E5-2620v4 is not supported.   
We expend PCM souce code to support Browdwell CPU, and you may refer to folder:
